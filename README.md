# Code Refactor
## Project 
-In this project we were tasked with overlooking the given code (index.html, style.css, reset.css). To check if any changes needed to be made to the code, and to condense it.
-I combined the attributes in css, so they would not be repetitive and short consice way of viewing the code. Also, chnaged a few tags in the index.html where it thought they needed to be changed.
## Closing 
-This code will run a webpage where you can see the the listed items in a easy to read manner.
## User Error
-I messed up on one of the side portions, and could not figure out how to place it where ir needed to go.
